A *trait* is a [*constraint*](./../_.md) whose [*type*](./../Type/_.md) is `std::core::trait::Trait`. *Trait* is always a *compile-time* [*object*](./../../Object/_.md).

A *trait method* is a declaration of an [*object*](./../../Object/_.md) that is mapped to a *trait*. When it is written that a [*type*](./../Type/_.md) implements a *trait*, it means that for this [*type*](./../Type/_.md) there are [*object*](./../../Object/_.md) mappings to each *trait method*.
