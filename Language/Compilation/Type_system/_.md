Aber's type system consists of three key components:
- [*Objects*](./Object/_.md)
- [*Functors*](./Functor.md)
- [*Constraints*](./Constraint/_.md)

They are subject to the following rules:
- A *functor* is an *object*
- An *object* has one *type*
- A *type* implements any number of *traits*
- *Types* and *traits* are *constraints*
- *Constraints* are *objects*
