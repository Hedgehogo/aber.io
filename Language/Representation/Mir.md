A *Medium-level intermediate presentation* (MIR) is a global state containing *objects*, *top-level names*, *realizations* and *trait realizations*.

A *name* is a reference to the *compile-time* *object*. A *top-level name* is a *name* that can be accessed from anywhere in the source code of a program.

A *implementation* is a *compile-time* mapping of one *object*'s *template* to several others, assigning a local name to each.

A *trait implementation* is the mapping of an *implementation* to a *trait template*.
