Aber's semantics consists of three key components: *functors*, *objects*, and *constraints*.
- A *functor* is an *object*
- An *object* has one *type*
- A *type* implements any number of *traits*
- *Types* and *traits* are *constraints*
- *Constraints* are *objects*
# Functor
A *functor* is an *object* whose *type* implements the *trait* `std::core::trait::Call`.

Referring to a *functor* is treated as a *call*. The *call* is divided into *arguments* and *return value*. 

Each *argument* is an *object*. For one *type* of *functor*, the number, order and types of *arguments* are fixed. The *return value* is an *object*. For each *type* of *functor* the *type* of *return value* is fixed.

Syntactically, a *call* must be followed by its *arguments*, separated by *whitespace syntax*. Then the whole construct together will be considered a *return value*. 

Example:
> Suppose we already have a *functor* that can be accessed by writing `max`.
> Also assume that its *arguments* can be number literals, and its *return value* can be a number.
> 
> Then the given expression: 
> ```aber
> max 10 15
> ```
> can be considered as:
> ```aber
> 15
> ```
