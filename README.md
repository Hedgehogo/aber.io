# Description
Aber is a high-level programming language inspired by languages such as Rust, Lisp, Elexir, and Zig. It includes high-level abstractions such as structures, unions and traits, compile-time computation and automatic generalization. But it also allows low-level memory access and platform-dependent code writing.
