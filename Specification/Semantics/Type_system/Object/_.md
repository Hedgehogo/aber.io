An *object* has one [*type*](./../Constraint/Type/_.md). An *object* has a *lifetime*.

A *generic object* is a bijection of a sequence of *compile-time* *objects* to an *object*.

A *generic argument* is an element of this sequence of *compile-time* *objects*.

A *generic parameter* is a *constraint* on an element of this sequence of *compile-time* *objects*.

Syntactically, [*call syntax*](./../../../../Syntax/_.md#call) is considered an *object* obtained by substituting *generic arguments* into *generic parameters*. 

The sequence of expressions that are the contents of the [*generic argument syntax*](./../../../../Syntax/_.md#generic argument) that are part of the [*call syntax*](./../../../../Syntax/_.md#call) are considered to be the first elements of the *generic arguments*. If the *generic argument syntax* is missing, the number of *generic arguments* is assumed to be zero. The remaining *generic arguments* not specified in this way are computed using the *rules of object inference*. The sequence length greater than the number of *generic parameters* causes an *unrecoverable compilation error*.

Examples:
```aber
object
```
```aber
object[35]
```
