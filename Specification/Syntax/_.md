A *character* is referred to as a Unicode grapheme cluster.

The entire document is a sequence of *statements*.
## Comment
A *comment* is a sequence of *characters* starting with `//` and ending at the end of a line.

Example:
```aber
// At the beginning of the line
```
## Whitespace
A *whitespace* is a sequence including only *comments* and the *characters* ` `, ⇥ (Tab) and ↵ (Newline).
## Literal
### Number
A *digit* is a *character* included in the set `0` - `9` or `A` - `Z`. A *base digit* is a *digit* that exists in the specified base. A *decimal digit* is a *base digit* with a base of 10. Unless otherwise specified, the default base is 10. Symbols `0` - `9` are mapped to the number range 0 - 9, and `A` - `Z` to 10 - 35.

A *number* is a sequence starting with the optional character `-`, and following it sequentially: optional sequence B, non-zero sequence N and optional sequence F.

The sequence B begins with a *decimal digit*, followed by a sequence of *decimal digits* or *characters* `_` and ends with the *character* `'`. The entire contents of sequence B except for the characters `_` and `'` are the base, written in decimal notation, for sequence N.
 
The sequence N begins with a *base digit* followed by a sequence of *base digits* or *characters* `_`. Its contents, except for the `_` *characters*, are the integer part of a number, written in positional notation.

The sequence F starts with the character `.` followed by a sequence containing only *base digits* and the *characters* `_`. Its contents, except for the *characters* `_` and `'`, are the fractional part of a number, written in positional notation.

**Integer number**

An *integer number* is a *number* that does not contain the sequence F.

Example:
```aber
3_005 // 3005 in decimal
```
```aber
16'FF // Hexadecimal, integer, 255 in decimal
```
```aber
2'01100101 // Binary, integer, 101 in decimal
```

**Floating point number**

A *floating point number* is a *number* that necessarily contains the sequence F.

Examples:
```aber
1.15
```
```aber
3'0.1 // Trinary, 1/3 in decimal
```
```aber
2'10. // Binary, 2 in decimal
```
### Char
A *char* is a sequence beginning and ending with `'` and containing a single *character* or *escape sequence*. If it contains a single *character*, it is content. If it contains an escape sequence, its result is content.

The *escape sequence* begins with the `\` *character* followed by a sequence of *characters*.

For *char* *escape sequences* are mapped to *character* according to the following table: 

| The character after `\` | The result  |
| ----------------------- | ----------- |
| `\`                     | `\`         |
| `n`                     | ↵ (Newline) |
| `t`                     | ⇥ (Tab)     |
### String

**String**

A string is a sequence starting with the *character* `"` and ending with the same *character* that is not part of an *escape sequence*, and contains a sequence of *escape sequences* and *characters* except for `"` and ↵ (Newline). The contents are sequentially standing *characters* and *characters* obtained by substituting *escape sequences*.

For *string* *escape sequences* are mapped to *character* according to the following table: 

| The symbol after `\` | The result  |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `"`                  | `"`         |
| `\`                  | `\`         |
| `n`                  | ↵ (Newline) |
| `t`                  | ⇥ (Tab)     |
| ↵ (Newline)          | (Nothing)   |

Any *characters* are allowed except `"` and ↵ (Newline) without `\` to the left of them.

Consecutive *strings* must be split via a non-zero *whitespace*.

Examples:
```aber
"Hello\t\n\"Aber\"!" // Hello	
                     // "Aber"!
```
```aber
"Hello\t\
\n\"Aber\"!" // Same as the first one
```
```aber
"""Hello\t\n\"Aber\"!" // Error
```

**Raw string**

A *raw string* is a sequence starting with number N of *characters* `"` and ↵ (Newline). Each following line starts with the sequence W followed by a sequence С of any *characters*. The last line contains the sequence W followed by N number of *characters* `"`.

The concatenation of all sequences C is the contents of the string.

The number N must be at least 3.

The sequence W must contain only the *characters* ` ` and ⇥ (Tab).

Examples:
```aber
"""
Hello	
"Aber"!
""" // Same as in ordinary strings
```
```aber
"""
	""Aber
""" // "\t\"\"Aber"
```
```aber
"""
		Hello
		Aber!
	""" // "\tHello\n\tAber!"
```

## Expression
A *meaningful syntactic unit* is any of the listed syntactic units: *number*, *char*, *string*, *pair*, *tuple*, *block*, *generic arguments*, *call*, *method call*, *child call*, *negative call* and *initialization*.

An *expression* is a sequence of *meaningful syntactic units* separated by *whitespace*.

Examples:
```aber

```
```aber
"hello"
```
```aber
10 "hello" 15.4
```

## Statement
A *statement* is a sequence containing sequentially: an *expression* or *assignment*, *whitespace*, the *character* `;` and *whitespace*.

```
"hello";
```
## Pair
A *pair* is a sequence starting with a single *meaningful syntactic unit* followed by *whitespace* and ending with the *character* `:`.

Example:
```aber
"count": 
```

## Tuple
A *tuple* is a sequence containing sequentially: 
- the *character* `(`
- *whitespace*
- any number of sequences I separated by the sequence S
- the optional sequence S
- the *character* `)`

The content is the sequence of *expressions* contained in the sequence I.

The sequence I starts with a non-zero *expression* and ends with *whitespace*.

The sequence S starts with the *character* `,` and ends with *whitespace*.

Examples:
```aber
() 
```
```aber
(10)
```
```aber
(42, )
```
```aber
(5, "hello")
```

## Block
A *block* is a sequence containing sequentially: 
- the *character* `{`
- *whitespace*
- any number of *statements*
- *expression*
- *whitespace*
- the *character* `}`

The contents are the contents of a sequence of *statements* and an *expression*.

Examples:
```aber
{}
```
```aber
{10}
```
```aber
{42; }
```
```aber
{5; "hello"}
```

## Generic arguments
A *generic arguments* is a sequence containing sequentially: 
- the *character* `[`
- *whitespace*
- any number of sequences I separated by the sequence S
- the optional sequence S
- the *character* `]`

The content is the sequence of *expressions* contained in the sequence I.

The sequence I starts with a non-zero *expression* and ends with *whitespace*.

The sequence S starts with the *character* `,` and ends with *whitespace*.

Examples:
```aber
[]
```
```aber
[10]
```
```aber
[42, ]
```
```aber
[5, Type]
```

## Identifier
An *identifier* is a non-zero *character* sequence that conforms to the following rules:
- It must not start with a *decimal digit*.
- It must not start with the *character* `-` followed by a *decimal digit*.
- It must not contain sequences `.`, `,`, `;`, `:`, `'`, `"`, `@`, `//`, `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`.
- It must not contain *whitespace*.
- It doesn't have to be `=`.

Examples:
```aber
foo
```
```aber
foo+bar
```
```aber
baz0-foo*$%
```

## Сall
A *call* is a sequence starting with an *identifier* and ending with optional *generic arguments*.

Examples:
```aber
foo
```
```aber
foo+bar[10]
```

## Method call
A *method call* is a sequence starting with the largest *expression* and the *character* `.` and ending with a *call*.

Examples:
```aber

bar 10::foo+bar
```
```aber
baz(10, "hello")::baz0-foo*$%
```

## Negative call
A *negative call* is a sequence starting with `@` and ending with the largest *expression*. It has higher priority than a *method call*, a *child call* or *initialization*.

Examples:
```aber
@foo
```
```aber
@foo.foo
```
```aber
@foo::foo
```

## Assignment
An *assignment* is a sequence starting with the largest *expression* and `=` and ending with the largest *expression*.

Examples:
```aber
a = foo
```
```aber
a = foo.foo
```
```aber
@bar = foo::foo
```

# Initialization
An *initialization* is a sequence containing sequentially: 
- the largest *expression*
- the sequence `::(`
- *whitespace*
- any number of sequences I separated by the sequence S
- the optional sequence S
- the *character* `)`

The contents of this *expression* and the sequence of the contents of the sequences I.

The sequence I starts with optional sequence F, continues with *expression*, and ends with *whitespace*. The contents are the optional contents of sequence F and the *expression*.

The sequence F contains sequentially: *identifier*, *whitespace*, the character `=`, *whitespace*. The content is *identifier*.

The sequence S starts with the *character* `,` and ends with *whitespace*.

Examples:
```aber
Type::(
	a = 10, 
	b = 15,
)
```
```aber
module::Type::(a = foo 10, b)
```
```aber
Some::(10)
```
