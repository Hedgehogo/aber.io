A *type* is an [*constraint*](Specification/Compilation/Type_system/Constraint/_.md) whose *type* is `std::core::type::Type`. A *type* is always a *compile-time* [*object*](Specification/Compilation/Type_system/Object/_.md). 

*Types* fall into three categories: 
- [*Primitives*](Primitive.md)
- [*Structures*](Structure.md)
- [*Unions*](Union.md)

A *type method* is an [*object*](Specification/Compilation/Type_system/Object/_.md) that is mapped to a *type*.
